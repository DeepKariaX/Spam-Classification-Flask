# Spam Classification
Spam, or unwanted commercial or mass e-mail, has recently become a major issue on the internet. Spam is a waste of time, storage space, and data transfer capacity.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical strategy for e-mail filtering. They commonly use a bag of words feature to identify spam e-mail. As a consequence, we'll build a rudimentary message classifier using the Naive Bayes theory.
