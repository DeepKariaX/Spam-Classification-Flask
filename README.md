# Spam Classification
Spam, or unwanted commercial or mass e-mail, has recently become a major issue on the internet. Spam is a waste of time, storage space, and data transfer capacity.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical strategy for e-mail filtering. They commonly use a bag of words feature to identify spam e-mail. As a consequence, we'll build a rudimentary message classifier using the Naive Bayes theory.

## Prerequisites:
Make sure that you have the following:
-  Python 3+ and pip (which comes with Python 3+)
-  sklearn
-  pandas
-  flask
-  An environment to work in - something like Jupyter or Spyder

## Running the App
To run the app, complete the following steps:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and a text editor installed.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run Spam_Classifier_Main.py and a link will be shown copy the link in browser and open. (Example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
